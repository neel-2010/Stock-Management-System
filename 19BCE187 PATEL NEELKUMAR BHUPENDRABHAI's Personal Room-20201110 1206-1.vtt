00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:20.640
Hello, man, myself, Neil Patel and our group has worked on a project talk management system.

2
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.800
1st of all, I will briefly explain to, you.

3
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.030
Of a project in this app in this.

4
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:36.179
In this app a user.

5
00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:42.750
And it will make, we'll create account basically our target audiences.

6
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.259
Soft keeper or any form or any.

7
00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:50.939
Agency owner or a person dealing with the stock.

8
00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:54.299
Uh, he he can manage stock.

9
00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:57.780
Oh, no, it.

10
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.469
1st of all any farmer will create account and then.

11
00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.459
Log in to the app, and then he will be able to add stock.

12
00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:10.620
You stop a filter stuff by integrity brand name.

13
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.329
Or by supplier, but user will also be able to dispatch for.

14
00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:18.510
Also able to view the dispatch.

15
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.409
The stock used that basic the concept used.

16
00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.299
In the base are in our physical concept, enter.

17
00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.439
Interfaces inheritance and use of keywords, like.

18
00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.459
If we can sign and then flashes object methods.

19
00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:38.849
And we have, and also in our classes.

20
00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:42.599
So 1st of all, I am going to explain the.

21
00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:45.780
This color is this is specifically for.

22
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.500
Giving the output in in some color.

23
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.099
Now will come to the user class.

24
00:01:53.099 --> 00:02:00.569
In user, plus we have defined variable user name, password our form.

25
00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:04.950
And this is the concept for the last.

26
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.639
Which may be committed.

27
00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:14.129
Or user name, password ID, idea of form name of a.

28
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.080
I'll use that on any.

29
00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.650
So, now, coming to the class minutes, this class management extends the user.

30
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.740
And then implement this color and in.

31
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.449
In user, plus I homemade check talks talk.

32
00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:43.860
In our class, it is in our class in the in this class in a class of this class.

33
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.039
And also make object of also make this better off this object.

34
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.680
And this is the constructor for this manage class.

35
00:02:57.449 --> 00:03:07.139
This is the private in our class talk to our or checkout this class this class will basically store basically a store or.

36
00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:11.879
Or 1 stock can take, for example, or.

37
00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:19.830
A user, or any form will have, we'll be having go down and we'll be storing 50 to 40 to 50.

38
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.250
And this is for starting that 40 or 50 elements.

39
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:32.669
In this class object will be of this class to starting to store the category item. Name supplier. How many items are.

40
00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:38.520
Total value of this stock, and this is the construct that image will initialize and.

41
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:47.129
You evaluate all these variables now, coming to the entering lock stock whenever.

42
00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:53.639
And then there were some, some object will call and then.

43
00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.419
We will, we will take input every item name.

44
00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:00.659
Company name, supplier, number of items.

45
00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:06.419
Price if user will enter a number of item list, we will, we will retake it.

46
00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:10.590
And it will, so we'll comments.

47
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.759
Please enter valid quantity. Same for the price.

48
00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:18.240
Please enter valid will take very price then.

49
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.949
And now coming to the view, stop.

50
00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:27.509
This method, especially for.

51
00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:32.728
We're showing that the current stock in the go down.

52
00:04:32.728 --> 00:04:37.588
What to place and.

53
00:04:37.588 --> 00:04:40.619
This will source top category and.

54
00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:45.088
Item name company, name, supplier.

55
00:04:46.798 --> 00:04:51.478
And we'll stop by category is the same as a matter but.

56
00:04:51.478 --> 00:04:55.588
But 1 difference is that the only.

57
00:04:57.418 --> 00:05:00.418
The only stop and will be so.

58
00:05:00.418 --> 00:05:06.389
So, on the category with user and touch a user.

59
00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.988
And this is for the same, there's talk of.

60
00:05:12.988 --> 00:05:17.519
Based on the email, the stock of particular item.

61
00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:21.178
Will be shown in this matter, you item.

62
00:05:21.178 --> 00:05:26.158
Now, coming to the dispatch is pet ID matter issues.

63
00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:32.488
This is for dispatching desktop is betting the stuff.

64
00:05:32.488 --> 00:05:36.449
So, if user ID is will be the greater, then.

65
00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:42.749
Then I'll talk item, install guide is the threshold of of total ID.

66
00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:49.228
Present in the stock inside, they will be greater than than and stock tech stock will be not.

67
00:05:49.228 --> 00:05:56.069
They're not in in program, if our ID will be less than 0T and also I will be out of range.

68
00:05:56.069 --> 00:06:02.249
And if if user will and want to spend more than the current or present.

69
00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:06.088
Number of quantity, or will be less than 0.

70
00:06:06.088 --> 00:06:09.778
More than more than present quantity then.

71
00:06:09.778 --> 00:06:14.369
So, the message.
